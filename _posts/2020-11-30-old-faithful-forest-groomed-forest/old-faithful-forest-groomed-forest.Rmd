+ Run 3 different models and compare 

# Model 1: Linear Regression (ST)

### Splitting Data (same for all models)

+ splits and cv object

### Recipe (same for all models)

### Linear Regression Model

### Tuning Hyperparameters

### Model Results

# Model 2: K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)


# Model 3: Random Forest (AN)

### Modified recipe to increase predictive performance (JP)

# Comparison

+ Plot comparing performance metrics

+ Explanation of best model

+ How to get predictions from test.csv
